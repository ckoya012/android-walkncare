# Walk-N-Care

#### About:

Our team prototyped a mobile app as a simple clinic booking platform for patients, and as a clinic management tool for employees. The functionality depends on the type of user that is currently logged in. This app was made in a group of 5 for SEG2105 in the F19 semester, a second year software engineering course at the University of Ottawa.

**Running the app:** Use any Android Studio virtual device or a phyiscal Android device.
